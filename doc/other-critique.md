# Critique of tacoboutaustin.me

## What did they do well?
* They were very creative with their use of tacos for the logos and rating systems
* They display a good amount of data for filtering their grid pages in the future.
* They have really well designed gird pages. These grid pages look like something
I would expect on a professional website.
* They have a nice simple design. I love how minimalist the website is!
## What did we learn from their api / website?
* We learned a better way to format our grid pages so that we can show more data
with each grid element. We were concerned that showing too many details on the grid
page would introduce clutter, but after seeing this team's design we have a better
idea of how to add more detail without adding clutter.
* We also learned some better front-end design ideas that make the website look
better.
## What can they do better?
* They were not finished with their rating system in their presentation, they need
to finish this so their site has the promised functionality.
* Their detail pages seemed to have some formatting issues that need to be fixed.
## What puzzles us about their api / website?
* I do not know what their website has to do with tacos. But the taco's are cool.
* We did not go much into detail about their API so I do not know much about it,
but they seemed to be returning a lot of data in their JSON responses which might
be able to be minimized to less data.
