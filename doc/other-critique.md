# Critique of tacoboutaustin.me

## What did they do well?

* Their site was very clean and intuitive.
* They had a great front-end design and layout. Their website is very quirky, but
  highly functional.
* Their search page returned results in a very clean and reasonable manor.

## What did we learn from their api / website?

* We decided to restructure our about page to look a bit more like theirs, but ours
  shows more data.
* We tried to make our website detail pages a bit more simplistic like theirs.
* We used the google map component for our national park location like they showed
  us.

## What can they do better?

* They were not showing enough relevant information on their search page.
* Their about page had some formatting issues.
* They needed to show more information but also balance that with their clean and
  simplistic design.

## What puzzles us about their api / website?

* I do not know what their website has to do with tacos. But the tacos are cool.
* We did not go much into detail about their API so I do not know much about it,
  but they seemed to be returning a lot of data in their JSON responses which might
  be able to be minimized to less data.
* I find it interesting that they handled all of their searching and filtering on
  the backend. We stayed away from this because we thought it might slow down the
  website a bit. With how little data we have, it seems more efficient to cache the
  data on the frontend and search, sort, and filter as needed.
