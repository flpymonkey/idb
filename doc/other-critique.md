# Critique of tacoboutaustin.me

## What did they do well?

* Their site was very clean and intuitive.
* They did a great job of addressing our user stories. They
  went beyond our expectations to not only address our stories, but to even add
  some features we did not specifically ask for.
* Their site layout works very well on both desktop and mobile. This is a great
  improvement from last phase when their layout was where most of the issues were.

## What did we learn from their api / website?

* We refactored some of our code based on the layout and design decisions they
  made on their website.
* We followed their lead on some examples for how to make our site more mobile
  friendly.

## What can they do better?

* Their about page still has some formatting issues on Safari.
* Some of the font on their site (particularly on the grid page) is really small,
  it would be nice to see a more consistent use of font sizes across their site.

## What puzzles us about their api / website?

* I still do not know what their website has to do with tacos. But the tacos are
  cool.
* They seem to be returning a lot of data in their API JSON responses which might
  need to be minimized to less data.
* I find it interesting that they handled all of their searching and filtering on
  the backend. We stayed away from this because we thought it might slow down the
  website a bit. With how little data we have, it seems more efficient to cache the
  data on the frontend and search, sort, and filter as needed.
