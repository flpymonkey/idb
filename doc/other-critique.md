# Critique of tacoboutaustin.me

* What did they do well?
  * They have really well designed gird pages. These grid pages look like something I would expect on a professional website.
  * They have a nice simple design. I love how minimalist the website is!
* What did we learn from their api / website?
  * We learned to include a /search/keyword endpoint for our API so people can search across all of our data for keywords.
  * We also learned some better front-end design ideas, such as having more details on our grid page!
* What can they do better?
  * Their about page is not formatted correctly and the photos are varying in sizes. I suggest fixing this.
  * Also their home page is off center, they need to re format it.
* What puzzles us about their api / website?
  * I do not know what their website has to do with tacos.
  * They were not finished with their API so I do not know everything they plan to do with it.
