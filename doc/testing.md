# Backend testing
We are using Postman to test our API endpoints at api.natphoto.me. We are using the Python unittest library to test our Python Flask code.

Tools we use for testing:

1. **Postman** - Software for testing API endpoints and automating unit testing on requests to api.natphoto.me

2. **unittest** - Used to test our Python Flask code which is used to serve the API endpoints.
