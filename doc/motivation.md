This website was created to make it easier for nature photographers to travel
with the right camera gear at the right time. We wanted to make a site that would
allow photographers to compare cameras, photos, and the locations where photos
are taken so they could improve their overall trip and photography. This site allows
photographers to compare specific cameras details by showing pictures taken on
cameras in specific locations as well as individual camera technical specifications.
Additionally, this site pulls data about national parks from NPS.gov so that
people can get a better idea of weather conditions, park hours, and park alerts
before they travel. This website is a one-stop-shop for picking the right camera
for the best possible photos in the best national parks in the United States!
