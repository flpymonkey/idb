# Self Critique

## What did we do well?

* We worked well as a team to make an aesthetically consistent and functional website
  that now has searching, sorting, and filtering.
* Our front-end team learned a lot about filtering and sorting with react-data-sort,
  React Dropdowns, creating child functions to set state in parents, and filtering
  using JavaScript's filter.
* Our back-end team was able to extend an API using Flask-RESTful running on an
  Amazon EC2 instance to efficiently get data to the frontend for searching, sorting
  and filtering.
* Back-end was very efficient at cleaning up the database to remove bad data and
  fill in missing data.
* Back-end also extended our robust data scraper to populate our database with
  more data from [www.nps.gov](www.nps.gov), [www.flickr.com](www.flickr.com), and
  [www.bestbuy.com](www.bestbuy.com)

## What did we learn?

* In general, we learned how to work within the bounds of a strict workflow that
  allows us to make user stories and, as a team, decide on how best to accomplish
  that user story in order to make it as well integrated with our site as possible.
* Our front-end team had little experience with React, react-strap, Mocha, and Selenium.
  We all learned the basics of these various tools in order to make a nicely designed
  and intuitive front-end for our website. We also learned about the relationship between
  parent and child components.
* Our back-end team learned how to use Amazon EC2 to host our API, Amazon S3 to
  host our React built site, Amazon RDS to host our database, SQLAlchemy for querying
  our database, Postman for API testing, and Flask-RESTful for serving our API endpoints.

## What can we do better?

* Our front-end team needs to tweak some of the design decisions for the website
  to make it more intuitive.
* Because the sorting, filtering, and searching are all done on the front-end, these
  functionalities could all be optimized.
* Some front-end tweaks need to be made so that our site looks better.
* We need more information on the gird page to filter by in the future.
* Our back-end team needs to fix a few issues with the data in the database

## What puzzles us?

* We were having trouble with React for our website. We need more practice styling
  our site with React so that our site looks better.
* The relationship between parent and child components can be quite complex. This is
  especially true when the child is setting the state in the parent.
* We need to figure out a better way to have regular weekly meetings so that we
  can more closely conform to the standards of Extreme Programming.
* Our back-end team needs to ensure that we are not getting charged by Amazon for
  our site hosting.
