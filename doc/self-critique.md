# Self Critique

* What did we do well?
  * We worked well as a team to make a aesthetically consistent and functional website. 
  * Our front-end team learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap in a short amount of time to create a site that is simple and interesting.
  * Our back-end team was able to create nice development and production environments using docker. We also outlined a simple, but highly functional, API that we can easily implement in a later project phase.
* What did we learn?
  * In general, we learned how to work within the bounds of a strict workflow that allows us to make user stories and, as a team, decide on how best to accomplish that user story in order to make it as well integrated with our site as possible.
  * Our front-end team had little experience with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React. We all learned the basics of these various tools in order to make a nicely designed and intuitive front-end for our website.
  * Our back-end team learned how to use Amazon EC2 to host our website. We also learned about using Docker for simplifying the deployment process.
* What can we do better?
  * We need to add bootstrap to the main page, detail pages, and about page.
  * Some small design and front-end tweaks need to be made so that our site looks better.
  * We need to make images line up on grids.
  * We need more information on the gird page to filter by in the future.
* What puzzles us?
  * We were having trouble with React for our website. We ended up not using it for the first version of the site, but we plan to research it more so we can learn about it and use it for the next iteration of the site.
  * We need to figure out a better way to have regular weekly meetings so that we can more closely conform to the standards of Extreme Programming.
