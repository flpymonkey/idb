# Self Critique

## What did we do well?

* We worked well as a team to make an aesthetically consistent and functional website.
* Our front-end team learned a lot about React, Mocha, and Selenium in a short amount
of time to create a site that is simple and interesting.
* Our back-end team was able to set up an API using Flask-RESTful running on an
Amazon EC2 instance.
* Back-end also learned about setting up a database using PostgreSQL on Amazon's
Relational Database Service which we can query using SQLAlchemy to serve up data
to our API endpoints.
* Back-end also set up a robust data scraper to populate our database with data
from [www.nps.gov](www.nps.gov), [www.flickr.com](www.flickr.com), and [www.bestbuy.com](www.bestbuy.com)

## What did we learn?

* In general, we learned how to work within the bounds of a strict workflow that
allows us to make user stories and, as a team, decide on how best to accomplish
that user story in order to make it as well integrated with our site as possible.
* Our front-end team had little experience with React, react-strap, Mocha, and Selenium.
We all learned the basics of these various tools in order to make a nicely designed
and intuitive front-end for our website.
* Our back-end team learned how to use Amazon EC2 to host our API, Amazon S3 to
host our React built site, Amazon RDS to host our database, SQLAlchemy for querying
our database, Postman for API testing, and Flask-RESTful for serving our API endpoints.

## What can we do better?

* Our front-end team needs to tweak some of the design decisions for the website
to make it more intuitive.
* Some front-end tweaks need to be made so that our site looks better.
* Back-end needs to add search functionality to the API so that anyone can research
our data by a keywords.
* We need more information on the gird page to filter by in the future.
* Our back-end team needs to fix a few issues with the data in the database

## What puzzles us?

* We were having trouble with React for our website. We need more practice styling
our site with react so that our site looks better.
* We need to figure out a better way to have regular weekly meetings so that we
can more closely conform to the standards of Extreme Programming.
* Our back-end team needs to ensure that we are not getting charged by Amazon for our
site hosting.
