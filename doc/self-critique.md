# Self Critique

* What did we do well?
  * We worked well as a team to make a aesthetically consistent and functional website. 
  * Our front-end team learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap in a short amount of time to create a site that is simple and interesting.
  * Our back-end team was able to create nice development and production environments using docker. We also outlined a simple, but highly functional, API that we can easily implement in a later project phase.
* What did we learn?
* What can we do better?
* What puzzles us?
