# NatPhoto.me

There is a lot that goes into a photograph. Natphoto.me shows off the  
beautiful United States National Parks while giving you an inside look at the  
lens that took the photo. The project connects cameras, photos  
taken by those cameras, and the locations of the photos \(one of the national  
parks in the US\).
