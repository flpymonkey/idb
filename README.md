# NatPhoto.me

There is a lot that goes into a photograph. Natphoto.me shows off the
beautiful Unitd States National Parks while giving you an inside look at the
lens that took the photo. The project connects cameras, photos
taken by those cameras, and the locations of the photos (one of the national
parks in the US).
